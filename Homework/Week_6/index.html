          Every 40 someone commits suicide. Many factors influence if someone will
          kill him or herself. Factors that can provoke suicide are for example:
          financial problems, mental health issues and social problems.
          On the other hand, social support and an possitive self image can
          be protective factors.
          Furthermore, members of religious communities tend to commit less
          suicide....
      </p>
      <p>
          Is it possible to see those factors on world scale?
          So, is there a higher suicide rate in countries where people have
          overall more financial problems?
          Is the oposite seen in countries where religion plays a big role?
